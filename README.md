# Restricted-ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
Rock-Paper-scissors in a new flavor (not so new if you know ).
This is an assignment by the odin project , it was my first time trying to build an actual responsive ui.

What i leanred: 
	-how to make complex javascript functions
	-I should care more about organising my code and write more comments to help me debug easier 
	-looking through the web for designs have made come across very helpful websites for design ideas so thats something to keep in mind
